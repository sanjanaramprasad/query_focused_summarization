Clichy-sous-Bois has a high unemployment rate compared to the rest of the country, about 20%, and 40% for the people under 25 years old (source : INSEE). The suburban riots of October 2005 originated in Clichy-sous-Bois after the death of two young boys who had been escaping a police control. Then the riots spread to other communes of the department, and then to virtually every major urban area in France. The majority of its population is of African heritage. the youth unemployment rate was 40%. 33% of the commune's residents were foreign nationals, higher than both the departmental average and the French national average.

      "Having already established the C5-R as a winning car, the development of the C6.R was more of an evolution of a design rather than an all new car which required long periods of testing and design. Pratt & Miller's process was aided by the fact that, unlike the C5-R which debuted several years after the C5 generation Corvette was on the streets, the C6.R and C6 generation Corvettes would be developed at the same time. This meant that design elements which would help the race car could be adapted to the road car, allowing the C6.R to use more exotic design features but still meet homologation requirements. In turn, this meant racing elements could be adapted to the Corvette Z06 performance car, which the C6.R shares it exterior styling with. Much of the framework of the road legal C6 was retained on the C6.R, leading to increased use of weight-saving aluminium. The road car would also replace the C5's pop-up headlamps with permanent designs integrated into the bodywork. This meant that the racing car would have better air flow over the front of the car, doing away with their replacements for the pop-up headlamps which stuck out of the bodywork. The large grill opening on the car would also serve to eliminate the variety of openings on the C5-R to feed not only the brake cooling ducts, but also help with downforce by exiting back out the top of the bonnet. Underneath, the C6.R retained much of the mechanical elements from the C5-R. The same Katech-built 7.0 litre V8 was used, but more closely based on the LS7 from the Z06. This engine, known as the \"LS7.R\", would go on to earn the Global Motorsports Engine of the Year award in 2006 for its performance and endurance capabilities. Like the C5-R, the C6.R lacked a rear window due to structural framework and fuel tanks taking up the space behind the cockpit. However, an innovation on the C6.R was the addition of a small video camera into the rear bumper, and a monitor placed on the roof of the cockpit. This allowed the drivers a better view behind them, instead of having to rely on their side mirrors. Another innovation was the use of an air conditioning system in the car in order to help drivers better endure high cockpit temperatures. This required the addition of a large suction fan to the rear of the car, as well as intakes integrated into the side mirrors. One innovation which the C6.R debuted in 2007 was the use of variable displacement. This system would disable half of the cylinders in the engine during caution periods in order to increase fuel economy when speed was not important. Although the system was tested during the season, its failure at the 2007 24 Hours of Le Mans led the team to remove it from the cars until it could be further evaluated. As of the end of the 2007 season, six C6.Rs had been built by Pratt & Miller. A seventh car, used for development work, was actually built on a C5-R chassis but adapted to carry C6.R bodywork. This car has never raced and is used merely as a show car, making its public debut alongside the C6 Corvette at the 2005 North American International Auto Show. It is a conversion of Corvette Z06 that resembles C6.R and shares components with the race car, produced by Pratt & Miller. It uses Katech Performance 8.2L engine rated 600 horsepower and 600 lb-ft torque. The car has top speed of 202 mph. The production began in April 2008. 25 were produced in the first year. Only 7 Corvette C6RS were ever built but the original intention was to build 25 cars. A version running E85 ethanol was created with Jay Leno, appeared in 2007 SEMA show. Convertible version was unveiled in 2008 12 Hours of Sebring. On September 9, 2008, Corvette Racing GM Road Racing Group manager Steve Wesoloski and Corvette Racing program manager Doug Fehan announced that for the 2009 ALMS season they would be running the C6.R in the GT1 class for only the first half of the season. After the 24 hours of Le Mans, Corvette Racing ran a newly designed C6.R in the GT2 class in preparation for the 2010 season's GT class regulations. The car uses a newly designed 6.0L V8 making 470 bhp, which is based on the 7.0L LS7.R from the GT1 car (which produced 590 bhp). As part of the GT regulations for 2010, the engine would be downsized to 5.5L to comply with the new engine displacement limits. The new GT2 car takes body styling cues from the then new Corvette ZR1 street car. The car sports a new aluminum frame (the GT1 car had a steel frame), smaller front splitter and rear wing, and steel brakes (the GT1 used carbon ceramic brakes), bringing it closer to the build of the Z06 road car. Due to its 5.5L motor displacement, the car was penalized with extra weight and waivers, much to the advantage of the competing Ferrari F430 GTC, whose powerplant generated the same 500 bhp but from a 4.0L V8. The new GT2 car began its campaign in the GT2 class starting with the 2009 Mid-Ohio race. Despite competing in a new class with a new car the #3 car of Jan Magnussen and Johnny O'Connell took 2nd in their first race and won their third race at Mosport after a long battle with the Risi Competizione Ferrari F430 GT. At 2010 24 Hours of Le Mans, factory GT2 Corvettes retired after engine problems and a collision with Anthony Davidson's Peugeot. Only one of four entered Corvettes - GT1 C6R of Luc Alphand Aventures - eventually finished the race, taking second place in class. This was the final year of GT1 in ACO racing. The Corvette was clocked at 182 mph down the Mulsanne Straight, which was the fastest GT car (GT1 and GT2). For the 2011 season, the Corvette saw several performance upgrades, most notably the addition of a paddle-shift transmission. This particular car has won the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans in the GTE-Pro category. In 2012, the C6.R took advantage of new regulations to grow 50mm wider at the wheelwells. This reportedly makes the car more stable and increases mechanical grip. Corvette Racing scored a 2nd-place finish at the 2012 12 Hours of Sebring and won the 2012 American Le Mans Series at Long Beach, the first win for Corvette since Mosport in 2011. At the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans, the #74 took an early lead of the race from the Aston Martin V8 Vantage GTE; however, a wheel fell off due to a missing wheel nut during the night which resulted in significant damage to the gearbox and other components. The #74 eventually finished unclassified due to not meeting the minimum percentage of the class winner. The #73 suffered tire issues and later had a broken steering rack which delayed the team for about an hour; the car finished 5th in class. Corvette Racing won the 2012 GT Team's and Driver's championship with 4 class wins. In 2013, Corvette Racing repeated its success and won the 2013 ALMS GT championships with 5 GT victories, including the 12 Hours of Sebring. V8 racing, Selleslagh Racing Team The first team to run a privateer Corvette C6.R GT2 car was the French-based Larbre Competition. In their first race with the car, they finished with a DNF at the 2011 12 Hours of Sebring, but would later come back to win the GTE-Am class of the 2011 24 Hours of Le Mans. They would also go on to win the GTE-Am class championship of the 2011 Intercontinental Le Mans Cup. For 2012, they are running in the FIA World Endurance Championship in the GTE-Am class again with two C6.R Corvettes. They repeated their Le Mans success by winning the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans in the GTE-Am class for a second year in a row after car No. 50 driven by ex-Peugeot Sport driver Pedro Lamy took the lead with less than an hour to go from the No. 67 IMSA Performance Matmut Porsche 997 GT3-RSR driven at the time by Anthony Pons. The Larbre Corvette, at 1260 kg, finished 20th overall ahead of the sole remaining factory Corvette. Car No. 70 finished fifth in class.\n"

      "The Paso Fino name means 'fine step'. The Paso Fino is a blend of the Barb, Spanish Jennet, and Andalusian horse and was bred by Spanish land owners in Puerto Rico and Colombia to be used in the plantations because of their endurance and comfortable ride. All Pasos share their heritage with the Peruvian Paso, the American Mustangs, and other descendants of Colonial Spanish Horses. Puerto Rican and Colombian horses, as well as Paso Finos from Cuba and other tropical countries, have been interbred frequently in the United States to produce the modern American Paso Fino show horse. On the second voyage of Christopher Columbus from Spain to the Americas in 1493, he disembarked with his soldiers, 20 horses and 5 mares on the island of Borinquen at the bay of Aguada (today Añasco), and gave the region the name San Juan Bautista. Soon after, in May 1509, the first governor of the island, Juan Ponce de León, brought horses to Puerto Rico from his hacienda, El Higuey, located on the neighboring island of La Española (now Hispaniola). The rise of the Paso Fino in the United States began in the 1950s and 1960s. The first Paso Finos in the United States were imported by members of the armed services, who purchased the horses while stationed in Puerto Rico. This stock provided some of the first Paso Finos bred in the United States. Colombian Pasos came to the United States beginning with a rancher who visited Colombia and purchased quite a number of the horses to work his cattle. He introduced the second strain into the US. While the two strains are still bred individually to retain their purity, they are also crossbred to produce the best of both strains. Today, the Paso Fino Horse Association (PFHA) oversees and regulates registered Paso Finos in the US. It was founded in 1972 under the name \"American Paso Finos\", later changing to its current name. It registers and promotes both Puerto Rican and Colombian horses, and under the PFHA, the two groups have been frequently crossbred. As the numbers of Colombian horses have begun to significantly outnumber those of Puerto Rican bloodlines, a trend has developed favoring preservation breeding to preserve the bloodlines of each group. The American \"Trote & Trocha\" Association formed to promote the horses, primarily of Colombian breeding, that perform a diagonal ambling gait known as the \"Trocha\". The Trocha differs from the classic lateral ambling gait of the Paso Fino. The Paso Fino tends to be refined, standing an average of but is powerful for its size. It has a convex head, clean legs and a relatively short back with prominent withers. Cannon bones tend to be short and the hooves are hard. The Paso Fino often has a thick mane and tail. It is found in all horse colors and there are no restrictions by the various breed associations. The Puetro Rican Paso Fino is the only breed in which tiger eye was found, which usually lightens the eyes to a striking amber, yellow, or bright orange color. The action of the two strains is somewhat different. The Puerto Rican Paso Fino is prized for its fine or delicate step, while the Colombian Paso Fino tends to have more of a rapid, piston-like action. This is a lively horse that has a natural drive and willingness, known colloquially as \"\"brio\",\" and generally an amiable disposition. Paso Finos come in a variety of colors, sizes and body types, but the even four-beat gait and brio are present in all good representatives of the breed. The Paso Fino executes a natural evenly spaced four-beat lateral ambling gait, similar to many gaited horses. Both the Colombian and the Puerto Rican strains of the Paso Fino execute the lateral gait naturally, without the aid of training devices. The Paso Fino's gaits are performed at varied levels of extension in stride. All four hooves travel close to the ground while in motion and are lifted equally in height as the horse covers ground. At whatever speed the horse travels, the smoothness of the gait ideally allows the rider to appear motionless with little up and down movement. Only a few Paso Finos can perform a true classic fino, but the majority perform the other gaits with ease. The correctness of the gait is very important by today's standards, therefore horses with a very even four-beat gait are much preferred for professional breeding. In Colombia, some related native horses perform a slightly different, unevenly timed diagonal four-beat gait, known as the \"trocha,\" which is similar to the fox trot, and very smooth. While some Paso Finos will perform the trocha, it is discouraged and considered a fault in the purebred Paso Fino. In Colombia the \"trocha\" has evolved, becoming a separate genealogical line. It is inherited in a manner similar to the lateral ambling gaits of the purebred Paso Fino. Trocha rivals in popularity with paso fino in Colombia, but crossbreeding is now avoided. Another Colombian breed performs what is known as \"trote y galope.\" The trote y galope horses perform an exaggerated diagonal two-beat trot and a very collected canter, but they do share some common heritage with the Paso Fino. Not as well known as Paso Fino, these variants are just beginning to be recognized in the United States. Paso Finos are versatile and are used in many disciplines. They have horse shows for the breed only, but are also seen competing in all-breed disciplines such as well as trail riding and endurance competition, driving and gymkhana.\n",

Since 1997 the agency has been known as USDA Wildlife Services. Responding to increasingly diverse requests for assistance, Wildlife Services has expanded its operational and research activities beyond its early emphasis on rabies and rodent control and livestock protection. Current programs now include threatened and endangered species conservation, the protection of public health and safety, wildlife disease surveillance and monitoring, research efforts emphasizing nonlethal methods and other activities and programs. In many situations, the individual or institution requesting assistance (the cooperator) contributes financially to the management activity conducted by Wildlife Services. Congressional appropriations fund some programs and projects, such as surveillance for disease. Many operational activities are partnerships with local, state and other federal agencies. Wildlife Services promotes an integrated wildlife damage management approach, which means conflicts are resolved by using a wide variety of methods to protect the valued property or agricultural resource, such as excluding wildlife from access and managing wildlife. Its staff responds to more than 200,000 human–wildlife interactions annually. Most are resolved using nonlethal methods including habitat modification, repellents, noise- and light-devices, and altered animal husbandry practices. It offers training to individuals and businesses. Wildlife damage management can engender controversy, often around the use of lethal controls. Most wildlife encountered in damage situations (5.1%) are dispersed rather than killed. Removal of native foxes/cyotes and non-native species, such as European starlings, feral swine and nutria, account for most of the animals removed. A 20-member National Wildlife Services Advisory Committee, appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture, advises the program and serves as a public forum. Wildlife Services has been the subject of widespread criticism on the part of conservation and wildlife protection organizations such as Defenders of Wildlife, Center for Biological Diversity, Predator Defense, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and others. These groups argue that Wildlife Services is not justified in killing millions of predators and other animals each year given the lack of evidence that these animals pose a threat to the public. Furthermore, the groups claim that this killing is conducted on behalf of the livestock industry rather than public safety and has resulted in the imperilment and near-extinction of dozens of species. Wildlife Services has also received criticism for its use of the M44 cyanide device for killing coyotes/fox and other Canids, as several incidents have occurred with family pets being killed as well as a male adult and a child almost killed from cyanide poisoning. A 2014 article in the \"Washington Post\" detailed Wildlife Services' extermination of 4 million animals in 2013, many of which were killed en masse. Amy Atwood, of the Center for Biological Diversity, was quoted in the article describing Wildlife Services' work as “a staggering killing campaign, bankrolled by taxpayers.” In fiscal year 2014, 2.7 million animals were reported as killed by Wildlife Services. A 2020 article in \"The Guardian\" described how Wildlife Services deploys cyanide \"bombs\" to kill wildlife. In 2017, fourteen year-old Canyon Mansfield was seriously injured and his dog killed by one such bomb.\n",
      "Catherine Chipembere was forced into exile from Malawi together with her husband and lived outside the country for 29 years. In 1994, after the end of Banda's rule, she returned to Malawi as a hero. She was elected as the first female member of the Malawian parliament. Later she served as the first deputy minister of education, science and technology and then as deputy minister of health and population. She was able to use her degree to oversee primary and secondary school education. She retired from her political career in 1998 and started the \"Women's Initiative Network\". In a widely publicised move, she decided to keep her husband's surname in spite of remarrying, as a political statement. She was sued by the Chipembere family for maintaining her Chipembere surname. Although ultimately winning the case, Catherine was removed from her post and residence in the government sector in 1998 by the Muluzi government. The Women's Initiative Network (WIN) is a non-profit network of Malawian women that holds empowerment workshops for young women which are led by her. The network collaborated with non-profit organisations like Global Soles in the US to bring shoes for orphans in Malawi in 2009. WIN Malawi operates in rural Mangochi and has built and sponsored twelve primary schools that educate, feed and care for over a thousand orphans. Most of the children are between two and six years old. Several of the orphans are AIDS orphans. In what ensued as a public scandal and a celebrated court case, the Chipembere clan sued Catherine for maintaining her Chipembere surname, though she remarried. She won this case and she was able to keep the surname as a political widow. She has seven children, including jazz musician Masauko Chipembere Jr.\n"

      "After a brief career in law, on 27 August 1774, Henderson organized a land speculation company with a number of other prominent North Carolinians. Originally called Richard Henderson and Company, the company name was first changed to the Louisa Company, and finally to the Transylvania Company on January 6, 1775. In March 1775, Henderson gathered chiefs of the Cherokee Indians and negotiated the Treaty of Watauga at Sycamore Shoals at present day Elizabethton, Tennessee, during which time he purchased all the land lying between the Cumberland River, the Cumberland Mountains, and the Kentucky River, and situated south of the Ohio River. The land thus delineated encompassed an area half as large as the present state of Kentucky. In order to facilitate settlement, Henderson hired Daniel Boone, who had hunted extensively in Kentucky, to blaze the Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap and into the Transylvania land purchase. Henderson also purchased the land known as the Path Grant that allowed access to the Transylvania lands. That purchase is described on the Path Grant Deed.\n",
      "To appease other prominent early explorers, Henderson held out other rewards. He offered Joseph Martin, founder of Martin's Station on Martin's Creek in present-day Rose Hill, Lee County, Virginia, a spot as an agent and entry taker for the company, in charge of keeping tabs on settlers moving westward; Henderson offered Martin's brother Bryce a tract of adjacent to the Cumberland Gap. Henderson followed Boone to a site that came to be called Boonesborough, located on the southern bank of the Kentucky River, Henderson encouraged the few settlers there to hold a constitutional convention. In May 1775, under the shade of a huge elm tree, a compact organizing a frame of government was drafted. The intended government entailed executive, legislative, and judicial branches. After concluding the Transylvania Compact, Henderson returned to North Carolina and on behalf of his fellow investors in the land scheme petitioned Congress seeking to make Transylvania America’s fourteenth colony. Despite those efforts, Congress was unwilling to act without the consent of Virginia and North Carolina, both of whom claimed jurisdiction over the region in question. In June 1776 the Virginia General Assembly prohibited the Transylvania Land Company from making demands on settlers in the region and in December 1778 declared the Transylvania claim void. North Carolina invalidated the remaining Tennessee portion of the purchase in 1783. Henderson and his partners instead received a grant of 200,000 acres on the Ohio River below the mouth of Green River. In 1778, Henderson briefly returned to the bench but resigned a short time later to pursue more land deals. In 1779–80 he headed another group of settlers into the Cumberland Valley in Tennessee and founded a settlement Fort Nashborough (present-day Nashville) in the French Lick area. In 1779, Judge Henderson was appointed one of six commissioners to run the line between Virginia and North Carolina into Powell's valley. He served as a captain (1779-1781) in the Granville County Regiment of the Hillsborough District Brigade in the North Carolina militia in the Revolutionary War. He represented Granville County, North Carolina he made the transivenia colony House of Commons of the North Carolina General Assembly in 1781. He was elected by the legislators to be one of the Councilors of State in 1782-83. He died at the age of 49 on January 30, 1785. He was buried on his farm near Williamsboro, North Carolina on Nutbush Creek. One of his sons, Leonard Henderson, was a Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court (18291833). Henderson, North Carolina was named for him. The other son, Archibald Henderson, was a legislator representing Rowan County, North Carolina. In Henderson's western Kentucky land grant on the Ohio, in an area named Red Banks, an early settlement became the town of Henderson, his namesake, in 1797. Later, Henderson County, Kentucky (seat Henderson) also named for him, subsumed the land grant. During the Treaty of Sycamore Shoals, Dragging Canoe, son of the Cherokee chief Attacullaculla, made a speech condemning the sale of Cherokee land and broke from the general Cherokee tribal government to form the sub-tribe known as the Chickamauga. This group went on to become the chief protagonists in the later Cherokee-American wars resulting from the settlement attempts. Ashland plantation house, Henderson's childhood home in North Carolina, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.\n"

      "Released in Japan as the Mega Drive in 1988, North America in 1989, and Europe and other regions as the Mega Drive in 1990, the Sega Genesis was Sega's entry into the 16-bit era of video game consoles. In 1990, Sega started its first internet-based service for Genesis, Sega Meganet, in Japan. Operating through a cartridge and a peripheral called the Mega Modem, it allowed Mega Drive owners to play 17 games online. A North American version, the \"Tele-Genesis\", was announced but never released. Another phone-based system, the Mega Anser, turned the Japanese Mega Drive into an online banking terminal. Due to Meganet's low number of games, high price, and the Mega Drive's lack of success in Japan, the system was a commercial failure. By 1992, the Mega Modem peripheral could be found in bargain bins at a reduced price, and a remodeled version of the Mega Drive released in 1993 removed the EXT 9-pin port, preventing connections to the Meganet service. In April 1993, Sega announced the Sega Channel service, which would use cable television services to deliver content. In the US, national testing began in June, and deployment began in December, with a complete US release in 1994. By June 1994, 21 cable companies had signed up to carry the Sega Channel service. US fees varied depending on location, but were approximately US$15 monthly, plus a $25 activation fee, which included the adapter. The Sega Channel expanded into Canada in late 1995, with an approximately Can$19 monthly fee. During the planning stages of the service, Sega looked to capitalize on the rental market, which had seen some success with the Sega CD being rented through Blockbuster, Inc., and was looking to base the service's games and demos to sell more cartridges. In early 1995, Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama ended development on the Sega Genesis and its add-ons, the Sega CD and Sega 32X. This decision was made to support the Sega Saturn, which had been released in Japan already. This placed the release of the Sega Channel during the Genesis' decline from the market. At its peak, the Sega Channel had over 250,000 subscribers, but by 1997, the number had dropped to 230,000, two years after Nakayama shifted focus from the Genesis to the Saturn. Though Sega looked at options to bring the service to PCs, the rise of cable modems and Internet gaming drove away the demand for such a service. In late November of 1997 it was announced that the Sega Channel would be shut down on June 30, 1998, but it ended up staying on for another month, finally being discontinued on July 31, 1998. After making the initial purchase and paying the activation fee, Genesis owners would receive an adapter that would be inserted into the cartridge slot of the console. The adapter connected the console to a cable television wire, doing so by the use of a coaxial cable output in the rear of the cartridge. Starting up a Genesis console with an active Sega Channel adapter installed would prompt for the service's main menu to be loaded, which was a process that took approximately 30 seconds. From there, gamers could access the content they wished to play and download it into their system, which could take up to a few minutes per game. This data would be downloaded into the adaptor's on-board 4 MB RAM, and would be deleted or removed when the system was powered off. Programming and transmission of the Sega Channel's monthly services started with a production team at Sega, which would put together content every month and load it onto a CD-ROM. It was then sent to TCI's satellite station, located in Denver, Colorado. From the station, the signal was transmitted via a Galaxy 7 satellite, which uploaded at 1.435 GHz and downloaded at 1.1 GHz, to the local cable providers. In Canada and across South America and Europe, however, the satellite transmission stage was bypassed altogether in favor of direct uploads of the Sega Channel CD-ROM via a cable television headend. In order for the signal to function properly, it had to be clear of noise in order to prevent download interruptions. To ensure no issues, cable providers had to \"clean\" their broadcast signal. The Sega Channel service hosted up to 50 Genesis games at any one time. Titles would rotate monthly; however, some updates happened on a weekly basis. In 1997, Sega changed the number of games hosted at a time to 70 and the update frequency to biweekly. Games for the service included titles developed by Sega, such as \"Sonic & Knuckles\", \"Eternal Champions\", and \"Space Harrier II\"; as well as titles developed by licensees of Sega, such as \"Bubsy 2\" and \"Aladdin\". Some of these games had reduced content compared to their cartridge release so that they could fit the adapter's memory, such as \"Super Street Fighter II\". The Sega Channel also hosted games in some regions that would not receive a cartridge release, such as \"Pulseman\", \"Mega Man: The Wily Wars\", and \"Alien Soldier\", which were hosted on the service in North America. The service also offered demos of upcoming games, such as \"Primal Rage\". Though games and demos rotated on a regular basis, categories into which games were placed remained static and did not change. With parental controls in mind, all games for the service received a rating from the Videogame Rating Council. The service also contained a lockout system which would allow parents to set a passcode in order to access mature-rated content. In addition to games and demos, the Sega Channel also hosted other features. Cheat codes were directly accessible from the network, as well as game hints. The service also hosted contests, such as a promotion with Electronic Arts' \"Triple Play '96\", and a 1995 event where players who completed \"Primal Rage\" during a brief 24-hour period where the full game was accessible were given a phone number to call, making them eligible to win prizes.\n"

      "This species was described by Townshend Stith Brandegee, the first botanist to explore the mountains of the Sierra de la Laguna. He found the plant flowering on the rocks at the summit of the mountains and named it a year later, in 1891, as \"Cotyledon nubigena\". The name \"nubigena\" implies cloudy summits, but despite this, Brandegee also recognized many plants at sea level near San Jose del Cabo.\n",
      "When Joseph Nelson Rose and Nathaniel Lord Britton were creating the genus \"Dudleya\", Rose made the decision to separate the lowland plants as \"Dudleya xanti\". The species \"xanti\" was named for L. J. Xantus de Vesey, a tidal observer at Cabo San Lucas for the U.S. Coast Guard Survey from 1859 to 1861. While at Cabo, Xantus traveled around collecting samples of plants, and among them was a specimen of \"Dudleya\". Asa Gray's 1861 account of the Xantus plant collections places the \"Dudleya\" specimens as \"Echeveria farinosa\" (which is now \"Dudleya farinosa\"). While Rose's descriptions showed that \"xanti\" was a smaller plant than \"nubigena\", Reid Moran noted that the claims made by Rose to differentiate the two were unsubstantiated, with the many specimens being hardly distinguishable. Moran then included \"Dudleya xanti\" back into \"Dudleya nubigena\". Moran later described the subspecies \"Dudleya nubigena\" ssp. \"cerralvensis\", an endemic of Cerralvo Island, occurring only in a few canyons shielded from the hot climate. He notes in his assessment the difficulty of describing \"Dudleya\" when comparing wild specimens with cultivated ones, stating that the morphological difference between a wild and cultivated plant may appear to be as great as two different species. Paul H. Thomson, author of the \"Dudleya and Hasseanthus Handbook\", retains \"Dudleya xanti\" as a separate species, but does not substantiate his claim as to why. Thomson's authority on \"Dudleya\" has been noted as unreliable by Moran. The Cerralvo Island species is very rare and only known from a few populations in cool canyons on the island. The mainland species occurs throughout the cape region up to 1500 meters, in the Sierra de La Laguna but also in some parts of the Sierra de la Giganta, like Cerro Mechudo, and also Espiritu Santo Island.\n"

      "The name Indianapolis is derived from the state's name, Indiana (meaning \"Land of the Indians\", or simply \"Indian Land\"), and \"\", the Greek word for \"city.\" Jeremiah Sullivan, justice of the Indiana Supreme Court, is credited with coining the name. Other names considered were Concord, Suwarrow, and Tecumseh. In 1816, the year Indiana gained statehood, the U.S. Congress donated four sections of federal land to establish a permanent seat of state government. Two years later, under the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818), the Delaware relinquished title to their tribal lands in central Indiana, agreeing to leave the area by 1821. This tract of land, which was called the New Purchase, included the site selected for the new state capital in 1820. The indigenous people of the land prior to systematic removal are the Miami Nation of Indiana (Miami Nation of Oklahoma) and Indianapolis makes up part of Cession 99; the primary treaty between the indigenous population and the United States was the Treaty of St. Mary's (1818). The availability of new federal lands for purchase in central Indiana attracted settlers, many of them descendants of families from northwestern Europe. Although many of these first European and American settlers were Protestants, a large proportion of the early Irish and German immigrants were Catholics. Few African Americans lived in central Indiana before 1840. The first European Americans to permanently settle in the area that became Indianapolis were either the McCormick or Pogue families. The McCormicks are generally considered to be the first permanent settlers; however, some historians believe George Pogue and family may have arrived first, on March 2, 1819, and settled in a log cabin along the creek that was later called Pogue's Run. Other historians have argued as early as 1822 that John Wesley McCormick, his family, and employees became the area's first European American settlers, settling near the White River in February 1820. On January 11, 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital. The state legislature approved the site, adopting the name Indianapolis on January 6, 1821. In April, Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham were appointed to survey and design a town plan for the new settlement. Indianapolis became a seat of county government on December 31, 1821, when Marion County, was established. A combined county and town government continued until 1832 when Indianapolis was incorporated as a town. Indianapolis became an incorporated city effective March 30, 1847. Samuel Henderson, the city's first mayor, led the new city government, which included a seven-member city council. In 1853, voters approved a new city charter that provided for an elected mayor and a fourteen-member city council. The city charter continued to be revised as Indianapolis expanded. Effective January 1, 1825, the seat of state government moved to Indianapolis from Corydon, Indiana. In addition to state government offices, a U.S. district court was established at Indianapolis in 1825. Growth occurred with the opening of the National Road through the town in 1827, the first major federally funded highway in the United States. A small segment of the ultimately failed Indiana Central Canal was opened in 1839. The first railroad to serve Indianapolis, the Jeffersonville, Madison and Indianapolis Railroad, began operation in 1847, and subsequent railroad connections fostered growth. Indianapolis Union Station was the first of its kind in the world when it opened in 1853. During the American Civil War, Indianapolis was mostly loyal to the Union cause. Governor Oliver P. Morton, a major supporter of President Abraham Lincoln, quickly made Indianapolis a rallying place for Union army troops. On February 11, 1861, President-elect Lincoln arrived in the city, en route to Washington, D.C. for his presidential inauguration, marking the first visit from a president-elect in the city's history. On April 16, 1861, the first orders were issued to form Indiana's first regiments and establish Indianapolis as a headquarters for the state's volunteer soldiers. Within a week, more than 12,000 recruits signed up to fight for the Union. Indianapolis became a major logistics hub during the war, establishing the city as a crucial military base. Between 1860 and 1870, the city's population more than doubled. An estimated 4,000 men from Indianapolis served in 39 regiments, and an estimated 700 died during the war. On May 20, 1863, Union soldiers attempted to disrupt a statewide Democratic convention at Indianapolis, forcing the proceedings to be adjourned, sarcastically referred to as the Battle of Pogue's Run. Fear turned to panic in July 1863, during Morgan's Raid into southern Indiana, but Confederate forces turned east toward Ohio, never reaching Indianapolis. On April 30, 1865, Lincoln's funeral train made a stop at Indianapolis, where an estimated crowd of more than 100,000 people passed the assassinated president's bier at the Indiana Statehouse. Following the Civil War—and in the wake of the Second Industrial Revolution—Indianapolis experienced tremendous growth and prosperity. In 1880, Indianapolis was the world's third largest pork packing city, after Chicago and Cincinnati, and the second largest railroad center in the United States by 1888. By 1890, the city's population surpassed 100,000. Some of the city's most notable businesses were founded during this period of growth and innovation, including L. S. Ayres (1872), Eli Lilly and Company (1876), Madam C. J. Walker Manufacturing Company (1910), and Allison Transmission (1915). Once home to 60 automakers, Indianapolis rivaled Detroit as a center of automobile manufacturing. The city was an early focus of labor organization. The Indianapolis Street Car Strike of 1913 and subsequent police mutiny and riots led to the creation of the state's earliest labor-protection laws, including a minimum wage, regular work weeks, and improved working conditions. The International Typographical Union and United Mine Workers of America were among several influential labor unions based in the city. Some of the city's most prominent architectural features and best known historical events date from the turn of the 20th century. The Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, dedicated on May 15, 1902, would later become the city's unofficial symbol. Ray Harroun won the inaugural running of the Indianapolis 500, held May 30, 1911, at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Indianapolis was one of the hardest hit cities in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in five known deaths and the displacement of 7,000 families. As a stop on the Underground Railroad, Indianapolis had one of the largest black populations in the Northern States, until the Great Migration. Led by D. C. Stephenson, the Indiana Klan became the most powerful political and social organization in Indianapolis from 1921 through 1928, controlling City Council and the Board of School Commissioners, among others. At its height, more than 40% of native-born white males in Indianapolis claimed membership in the Klan. While campaigning in the city in 1968, Robert F. Kennedy delivered one of the most lauded speeches in 20th century American history, following the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. As in most U.S. cities during the Civil Rights Movement, the city experienced strained race relations. A 1971 federal court decision forcing Indianapolis Public Schools to implement desegregation busing proved controversial. Under the mayoral administration of Richard Lugar, the city and county governments restructured, consolidating most public services into a new entity called Unigov. The plan removed bureaucratic redundancies, captured increasingly suburbanizing tax revenue, and created a Republican political machine that dominated Indianapolis politics until the 2000s. Unigov went into effect on January 1, 1970, increasing the city's land area by and population by 268,366 people. It was the first major city-county consolidation to occur in the United States without a referendum since the creation of the City of Greater New York in 1898. Amid the changes in government and growth, the city invested in an aggressive strategy to brand Indianapolis as a sports tourism destination, known as the Indianapolis Project. Under the administration of the city's longest-serving mayor, William Hudnut (1976–1992), millions of dollars were poured into sport facilities and public relations campaigns as part of an economic development strategy. The strategy was successful in landing the U.S. Olympic Festival in 1983, securing the 1984 relocation of the NFL Baltimore Colts, and hosting the 1987 Pan American Games. Economic development initiatives focused on revitalizing the city's downtown continued in the 1990s under the mayoral administration of Stephen Goldsmith. During this period, a number of cultural amenities were completed at White River State Park, the Canal Walk continued development, Circle Centre Mall was completed, and new sports venues (Victory Field and Conseco Fieldhouse, now Gainbridge Fieldhouse) were opened. In 1999, several cultural districts were designated to capitalize on cultural assets within historically significant neighborhoods unique to the city's heritage as a means to promote continued economic development. During the 2000s, the city invested heavily in infrastructure projects, including two of the largest building projects in the city's history: the $1.1 billion Indianapolis International Airport Colonel H. Weir Cook Terminal and $720 million Lucas Oil Stadium, both opened in 2008. A $275 million expansion of the Indiana Convention Center was completed in 2011. Construction began that year on DigIndy, a $1.9 billion project to correct the city's combined sewer overflows by 2025. Rapid transit was reintroduced to Indianapolis with the opening of IndyGo's $96 million Red Line bus rapid transit project in 2019. Indianapolis is located in the East North Central region of the Midwestern United States, about south-southeast of Indiana's geographic center. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the Indianapolis (balance) encompasses a total area of , of which is land and is water. It is the 18th largest city by land area in the U.S.\n",
      "As a consolidated city-county, the city's municipal boundaries are coterminous with Marion County, except the autonomous and semi-autonomous municipalities outlined in Unigov. Nine civil townships form the broadest geographic divisions within the city and county. The consolidated city-county borders the adjacent counties of Boone to the northwest; Hamilton to the north; Hancock to the east; Shelby to the southeast; Johnson to the south; Morgan to the southwest; and Hendricks to the west. Indianapolis is located within a physiographic province known as the Tipton Till Plain, a flat, gently rolling terrain underlain by glacial deposits known as till. The lowest point in the city is about above mean sea level, with the highest natural elevation at about above sea level. Few hills or short ridges, known as kames, rise about to above the surrounding terrain. The city lies just north of the Indiana Uplands, a region characterized by rolling hills and high limestone content. Indianapolis is located in the West Fork White River drainage basin, part of the larger Mississippi River watershed via the Wabash and Ohio rivers. The White River is fed by some 35 tributaries, including Fall Creek and Pogue's Run, as it flows north to south through Indianapolis. The city's largest water bodies are artificial quarry lakes or reservoirs. Indianapolis is situated in the Southern Great Lakes forests ecoregion which in turn is located within the larger temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome, as defined by the World Wide Fund for Nature. Based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency's alternative classification system, the city is located in the Eastern Corn Belt Plains, an area of the U.S. known for its fertile agricultural land. Much of the decidious forests that once covered 98% of the region were cleared for agriculture and urban development, contributing to considerable habitat loss. Indianapolis's current urban tree canopy averages approximately 33%. A rare example of old-growth forest in the city can be found on of Crown Hill Cemetery's North Woods in the Butler–Tarkington neighborhood. The cemetery's represents the largest green space in Center Township, home to an abundance of wildlife and some 130 species of trees. Native trees most common to the area include varieties of ash, maple, and oak. Several invasive species are also common in Indianapolis, including tree of heaven, wintercreeper, Amur honeysuckle, and Callery or Bradford pear. A 2016 bioblitz along three of the city's riparian corridors found 590 taxa. Urban wildlife common to the Indianapolis area include mammals such as the white-tailed deer, eastern chipmunk, eastern cottontail, and the eastern grey and American red squirrels. In recent years, local raccoon and groundhog populations have increased alongside sightings of American badgers, beavers, mink, coyotes, and red fox. Birds native to the area include the northern cardinal, wood thrush, eastern screech owl, mourning dove, pileated and red-bellied woodpeckers, and wild turkey. Located in the Mississippi Flyway, the city sees more than 400 migratory bird species throughout the year. Some 57 species of fish can be found in the city's waterways, including bass and sunfish. Some federally-designated endangered and threatened species are native to the Indianapolis area, including several species of freshwater mussels, the rusty patched bumble bee, Indiana bat, northern long-eared bat, and the running buffalo clover. In recent years, the National Wildlife Federation has ranked Indianapolis among the ten most wildlife-friendly cities in the U.S. Indianapolis has a hot-summer humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification \"Dfa\"), but can be considered a borderline humid subtropical climate (Köppen: \"Cfa\") using the isotherm.

Indianapolis is a planned city. On January 11, 1820, the Indiana General Assembly authorized a committee to select a site in central Indiana for the new state capital, appointing Alexander Ralston and Elias Pym Fordham to survey and design a town plan for Indianapolis. Ralston had been a surveyor for the French architect Pierre L'Enfant, assisting him with the plan for Washington, D.C. Ralston's original plan for Indianapolis called for a town of , near the confluence of the White River and Fall Creek. The plan, known as the \"Mile Square\", is bounded by East, West, North, and South streets, centered on a traffic circle, called Monument Circle (originally Circle Street), from which Indianapolis's \"Circle City\" nickname originated. Four diagonal streets radiated a block from Monument Circle: Massachusetts, Virginia, Kentucky, and Indiana avenues. The city's address numbering system begins at the intersection of Washington and Meridian streets. Before its submersion into a sanitary tunnel, Pogue's Run was included into the plan, disrupting the rectilinear street grid to the southeast. Compared with similar-sized American cities, Indianapolis is unique in that it contains some 200 farms covering thousands of acres of agricultural land within its municipal boundaries. Equestrian farms and corn and soybean fields interspersed with suburban development are commonplace on the city's periphery, especially in Franklin Township. Noted as one of the finest examples of the City Beautiful movement design in the U.S., the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza Historic District began construction in 1921 in downtown Indianapolis. The district, a National Historic Landmark, encompasses several examples of neoclassical architecture, including the American Legion, Central Library, and Birch Bayh Federal Building and United States Courthouse. The district is also home to several sculptures and memorials, \"Depew Memorial Fountain\", and open space, hosting many annual civic events. After completion of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, an ordinance was passed in 1905 restricting building heights on the traffic circle to to protect views of the monument. The ordinance was revised in 1922, permitting buildings to rise to , with an additional allowable with a series of setbacks. A citywide height restriction ordinance was instituted in 1912, barring structures over . Completed in 1962, the City-County Building was the first skyscraper in the city, surpassing the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument in height by nearly . A building boom, lasting from 1982 to 1990, saw the construction of six of the city's ten tallest buildings. The tallest is Salesforce Tower, completed in 1990 at . Indiana limestone is the signature building material in Indianapolis, widely included in the city's many monuments, churches, academic, government, and civic buildings. For statistical purposes, the consolidated city-county is organized into 99 \"neighborhood areas\" with most containing numerous individual historic and cultural districts, subdivisions, and some semi-autonomous towns. In total, some 500 self-identified neighborhood associations are registered in the city's Registered Community Organization system. As a result of the city's expansive land area, Indianapolis has a unique urban-to-rural transect, ranging from dense urban neighborhoods to suburban tract housing subdivisions, to rural villages. Typical of American cities in the Midwest, Indianapolis urbanized in the late-19th and early-20th centuries, resulting in the development of relatively dense, well-defined neighborhoods clustered around streetcar corridors, especially in Center Township. Notable streetcar suburbs include Broad Ripple, Irvington, and University Heights. Starting in the mid-20th century, the post–World War II economic expansion and subsequent suburbanization greatly influenced the city's development patterns. From 1950 to 1970, nearly 100,000 housing units were built in Marion County, most outside Center Township in suburban neighborhoods such as Castleton, Eagledale, and Nora. Since the 2000s, Downtown Indianapolis and surrounding neighborhoods have seen increased reinvestment mirroring nationwide market trends, driven by empty nesters and millennials. Renewed interest in urban living has been met with some dispute regarding gentrification and affordable housing. According to a Center for Community Progress report, neighborhoods like Cottage Home and Fall Creek Place have experienced measurable gentrification since 2000. The North Meridian Street Historic District is among the most affluent urban neighborhoods in the U.S., with a mean household income of $102,599 in 2017. Indianapolis maintains 212 public parks covering of green space, representing about 5.1% of the city's land area.

Military Park was established as the city's first state-owned park in 1852. Garfield Park was the city's first municipally-owned park, opening in 1876 as Southern Park. In the early-20th century, the city enlisted landscape architect George Kessler to conceive a framework for Indianapolis's modern parks system. Kessler's 1909 Indianapolis Park and Boulevard Plan linked notable parks, such as Brookside, Ellenberger, Garfield, and Riverside parks, with a system of parkways following the city's waterways. The system's were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Marion County is home to two Indiana state parks: Fort Harrison State Park in Lawrence and White River State Park in downtown Indianapolis. Established in 1996, Fort Harrison State Park covers under the management of the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. White River is owned and operated by the White River State Park Development Commission, a quasi-governmental agency. Encompassing , White River is the city's major urban park, home to the Indianapolis Zoo, White River Gardens, and museums. Two land trusts are active in the city managing several sites for nature conservation throughout the region. The U.S. Census Bureau considers Indianapolis as two entities: the consolidated city and the city's remainder, or balance. The consolidated city is coterminous with Marion County, except the independent municipalities of Beech Grove, Lawrence, Southport, and Speedway. The city's balance excludes the populations of ten semi-autonomous municipalities that are included in totals for the consolidated city. These are Clermont, Crows Nest, Homecroft, Meridian Hills, North Crows Nest, Rocky Ripple, Spring Hill, Warren Park, Williams Creek, and Wynnedale. An eleventh town, Cumberland, is partially included. In 2018 estimates, the city's consolidated population was 876,862 and its balance was 867,125.

The public library serves about 280,000 cardholders with a circulation of nearly 10 million materials annually. Indianapolis is served by various print media. Founded in 1903, \"The Indianapolis Star\" is the city's daily morning newspaper. The \"Star\" is owned by Gannett Company, with a daily circulation of 127,064. The \"Indianapolis News\" was the city's daily evening newspaper and oldest print media, published from 1869 to 1999. Notable weeklies include \"NUVO\", an alternative weekly newspaper, the \"Indianapolis Recorder\", a weekly newspaper serving the local African American community, the \"Indianapolis Business Journal\", reporting on local real estate news, and the \"Southside Times\". \"Indianapolis Monthly\" is the city's monthly lifestyle publication. Broadcast television network affiliates include WTTV 4 (CBS), WRTV 6 (ABC), WISH-TV 8 (The CW), WTHR-TV 13 (NBC), WDNI-CD 19 (Telemundo), WFYI-TV 20 (PBS), WNDY-TV 23 (MyNetworkTV), WUDZ-LD 28 (Buzzr), WSDI-LD 30 (Ve Plus TV), WHMB-TV 40 (Family), WCLJ-TV 42 (Bounce TV), WALV-CD 46 (MeTV), WBXI-CD 47 (Start TV), WXIN-TV 59 (Fox), WIPX-TV 63 (Ion) and WDTI 69 (Daystar). In 2019, the Indianapolis metropolitan area was the 25th largest television market in the U.S.\n",
      "The majority of commercial radio stations in the city are owned by Cumulus Media, Emmis Communications, iHeartMedia, and Urban One. Popular nationally syndicated radio program \"The Bob & Tom Show\" has been based at Indianapolis radio station WFBQ since 1983. In 2019, the Indianapolis metropolitan area was the 39th largest radio market in the U.S. Indianapolis's transportation infrastructure comprises a complex network that includes a local public bus system, several private intercity bus providers, Amtrak passenger rail service, four freight rail lines, four primary and two auxiliary Interstate Highways, two airports, a heliport, bikeshare system, of bike lanes, and of trails and greenways. Private ridesharing companies Lyft and Uber as well as taxicabs operate in the city. After negotiations with city officials, Bird and Lime electric scooter-sharing launched in September 2018. Absent a comprehensive regional public transit system in combination with urban sprawl, Indianapolis residents drive more vehicle miles per capita than any other U.S. city. According to the 2016 American Community Survey, 83.7% of working residents in the city commuted by driving alone, 8.4% carpooled, 1.5% used public transportation, and 1.8% walked. About 1.5% used all other forms of transportation, including taxicab, motorcycle, and bicycle. About 3.1% of working city residents worked at home. In 2015, 10.5 percent of Indianapolis households lacked a car, which decreased to 8.7 percent in 2016, the same as the national average in that year. Indianapolis averaged 1.63 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8. Four primary Interstate Highways intersect the city: Interstate 65, Interstate 69, Interstate 70, and Interstate 74. The metropolitan area also has two auxiliary Interstate Highways: a beltway (Interstate 465) and connector (Interstate 865). A $3 billion expansion project to extend Interstate 69 from Evansville to Indianapolis is in progress. The Indiana Department of Transportation manages all Interstates, U.S. Highways, and Indiana State Roads within the city. The city's Department of Public Works maintains about of street, in addition to 540 bridges, alleys, sidewalks, and curbs. Reliance on driving has impacted the city's walkability, with Walk Score ranking Indianapolis as one of the least walkable large cities in the U.S. However, city officials have increased investments in bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure in recent years. About of trails and greenways form the core of the city's active transportation network, connecting into of on-street bike lanes. Trails and greenways include the Fall Creek Greenway, Pleasant Run Greenway, and Monon Trail. The Monon is notable as a rail trail and part of the United States Bicycle Route System. The privately managed Indianapolis Cultural Trail provides of separated bike and pedestrian corridors and operates Indiana Pacers Bikeshare, the city's bicycle-sharing system, consisting of 525 bicycles at 50 stations. Indianapolis is designated a \"Bronze Level\" Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists. Indianapolis International Airport (IATA: IND) sits on approximately southwest of downtown Indianapolis. IND is the busiest airport in the state, serving more than 9.4 million passengers annually. Completed in 2008, the Colonel H. Weir Cook Terminal contains two concourses and 40 gates, connecting to 51 nonstop domestic and international destinations and averaging 145 daily departures. As home to the second largest FedEx Express hub in the world, IND ranks among the ten busiest U.S. airports in terms of air cargo throughput. The Indianapolis Airport Authority is a municipal corporation that oversees operations at five additional airports in the region, two of which are located in the city: Eagle Creek Airpark (FAA LID:EYE), a relief airport for IND, and the Indianapolis Downtown Heliport (IATA: 8A4). The Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation, doing business as IndyGo, operates the city's public bus system serving 9.2 million annual passenger trips in 2019. IndyGo's Julia M. Carson Transit Center opened in 2016 as the downtown hub for 27 of its 31 bus routes. In 2017, City-County Council approved a voter referendum increasing Marion County's income tax to help fund IndyGo's first major system expansion since its 1975 founding. Local taxes and federal grants will fund systemwide improvements, including the creation of three bus rapid transit lines, battery electric buses, sidewalks, bus shelters, extended hours and weekend schedules. Of the three bus rapid transit projects, the Red Line began service on September 1, 2019 and construction began on the Purple Line on February 25, 2022. Groundbreaking on the Blue Line is anticipated in 2024. The Central Indiana Regional Transportation Authority (CIRTA) is a quasi-governmental agency that organizes regional car and vanpools and operates three public workforce connectors from Indianapolis to employment centers in Plainfield and Whitestown. Several private intercity bus service providers stop in the city. Greyhound Lines operates a bus terminal at Union Station and stop at Indianapolis International Airport's Ground Transportation Center. Barons Bus Lines, Burlington Trailways, and Miller Transportation's Hoosier Ride also stop at Greyhound's Union Station bus terminal. Megabus stops at the corner of North Alabama Street and East Market Street near the Indianapolis City Market. GO Express Travel manages two shuttle services: GO Green Express between downtown Indianapolis and the Indianapolis International Airport and Campus Commute between IUPUI and Indiana University Bloomington. OurBus began daily service between Indianapolis and Chicago, with stops in Zionsville and Lafayette, filling a gap left after Amtrak's \"Hoosier State\" was discontinued in July 2019. Amtrak, the national passenger rail system, provides inter-city rail service to Indianapolis via Union Station, serving about 30,000 passengers in 2015. The \"Cardinal\" makes three weekly trips between New York City and Chicago. Amtrak's Beech Grove Shops, in the enclave of Beech Grove, serve as its primary heavy maintenance and overhaul facility, while the Indianapolis Distribution Center is the company's largest material and supply terminal. About of freight rail lines converge in the city, including one Class I railroad (CSX Transportation), one Class II railroad (Indiana Rail Road Company), and two shortline railroads (Indiana Southern Railroad and Louisville and Indiana Railroad). Indianapolis is a hub for CSX Transportation, home to its division headquarters, an intermodal terminal, and classification yard in the suburb of Avon. Health & Hospital Corporation of Marion County, a municipal corporation, was formed in 1951 to manage the city's public health facilities and programs, including the Marion County Public Health Department and Eskenazi Health. Eskenazi Health operates 11 primary care centers across the city, including its flagship medical center, Sidney & Lois Eskenazi Hospital. The hospital includes an Adult Level I Trauma Center, 315 beds, and 275 exam rooms, annually serving about 1 million outpatients. The Veterans Health Administration's Richard L. Roudebush VA Medical Center is Indiana's tertiary referral hospital for former armed services personnel, treating more than 60,000 veterans annually. The Indiana Family and Social Services Administration oversees the NeuroDiagnostic Institute, a 159-bed psychiatric hospital which replaced Larue D. Carter Memorial Hospital in 2019. Indiana University Health, a nonprofit hospital network, operates three teaching hospitals in Indianapolis: University Hospital, Methodist Hospital, and Riley Hospital for Children. The medical centers are anchored by the Indiana University School of Medicine's principal research and education campus, the largest allopathic medical school in the U.S. Riley Hospital for Children is among the nation's foremost pediatric health centers, recognized in all ten specialties by \"U.S. News and World Report\". The 430-bed facility also contains Indiana's only Pediatric Level I Trauma Center. In 2020, IU Health detailed plans to consolidate University and Methodist hospitals and replace Methodist with a new $1.6 billion medical center, to open in 2026. Other private and nonprofit healthcare networks with a presence in the city include Ascension (St. Vincent Indianapolis Hospital); Franciscan Health (Franciscan Health Indianapolis); and Community Health Network (Community Hospital East, Community Hospital North, and Community Hospital South). AES Indiana provides 3,000 megawatts of electricity to more than 500,000 customers. Citizens Energy Group, the only public charitable trust formed to operate utilities in the U.S., provides residents with natural gas, water, wastewater, and thermal services. Citizens' Perry K. Generating Station produces steam for the downtown Indianapolis district heating system, the second largest in the U.S.\n",
      "The city's water is supplied through four surface water treatment plants, drawing from the White River, Fall Creek, and Eagle Creek Reservoir; and five pumping stations, providing water supply from groundwater aquifers. Additional water supply is ensured by four reservoirs in the region, including Citizens, Eagle Creek, Geist, and Morse. Eleven solid waste districts are managed by one of three garbage collection providers: the city's Department of Public Works Solid Waste Division, Republic Services, and Waste Management. Residential curbside recycling is a subscription service provided by Republic Services and Ray's Trash Service. Recycling drop-off sites located throughout the city are provided free of charge by the Department of Public Works Solid Waste Division. Covanta Energy operates a waste-to-energy plant in the city, processing solid waste for steam production. Indianapolis has nine sister cities and one former sister city. The Indianapolis Sister Cities International program was founded to promote the international exchange of commerce, culture, diplomacy, and education in accordance with Sister Cities International. Listed in the order each agreement was first established, they are: , Indianapolis contains ten foreign consulates, serving Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland.\n",
      "Truth Initiative was founded in 1999 as a result of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA). The MSA was announced in 1998, resolving the lawsuits brought by 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and five territories against the major U.S. cigarette companies, to recover state Medicaid and other costs from caring for sick smokers. The four other states settled separately. The tobacco industry agreed to pay the states billions of dollars in perpetuity, making the MSA the then-largest civil litigation settlement in U.S. history. The states directed that a portion of the money they received from the settlement should be used to establish a national public health foundation dedicated to prevent youth smoking and helping smokers quit: the American Legacy Foundation, now Truth Initiative. In 2018, the Truth Initiative partnered with Office of National Drug Control Policy and the Ad Council to combat opioid addiction. Researchers in the Truth Initiative Schroeder Institute publish dozens of peer-reviewed research articles each year with the goal of identifying methods to minimize the harms of tobacco use, measure the effectiveness of interventions and identify best practices for tobacco control. Research is also done to assess the Truth campaign's efforts, both pre-and post-market, including the use of the longitudinal Truth Longitudinal Cohort (TLC) survey of more than 10,000 young people and a continuous tracking study to assess campaign awareness and message receptivity. In the early 2000s the American Legacy Foundation (as the Truth Initiative was then known) gave around $10 million of the settlement funds it managed to the University of California San Francisco (USCF) to help it formalize and expand the collection of internal tobacco industry documents that its library already hosted; the collection was then named the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library. As of May 2017, the library contained 14.7 million internal documents (nearly 89 million pages) created by major tobacco companies related to their advertising, manufacturing, marketing, sales and scientific research activities. Truth Initiative provides individuals, coalitions, and organizations information and methods to reduce tobacco use in their communities. The organization trains and educates young people interested in tobacco control and partners with community-serving organizations to reduce tobacco use. This includes a grant program for community colleges and historically black colleges and universities to create tobacco-free campuses. Examples of youth activism programs include:\n",
      "\n",
      "These community engagement programs are often an \"on the ground\" extension of the Truth campaign's work. Supporters of the campaign are called upon to support other anti-tobacco issues, such as a 2017 rally outside a Walgreens shareholders meeting in New York that was organized to pressure the pharmacy's board of directors to stop selling tobacco in its stores. The innovations center within Truth Initiative designs, builds and markets digital smoking cessation and prevention products that are centered around online social networks, text messaging and web and mobile applications. Any revenue generated by the innovations programs helps support other work at the organization. Examples of these programs include: Truth Initiative is led by a senior leadership team with representatives from each of its functional program areas. Headed by CEO and President Robin Koval, this team includes: In addition to awards for its Truth campaign, including being named among the top 10 ad campaigns of the 21st century, Truth Initiative has also been recognized with the following:\n"

      "Mohammad Javad Bahonar was born on 3 September 1933 in Kerman, Iran. His father was a simple tradesman and had a little shop in the city of Kerman. He was the second child of nine, and his family was very poor. As a child, he was taught the Quran at the local Makk-tab-Khaneh (parochial school attended by the students very often at the house of local mullah before national school system was put in place) also learning to read and write Persian. Guided by the Ayatollah Haghighi, he studied at the Masoumieh seminary. At the same time he could obtain the degree of fifth of ancient school. Bahonar passed his primary school at Masoumieh School of Kerman. In 1953, he went to Qom Seminary and attended in the class of Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of Iranian revolution. He received a PhD in theology from the University of Tehran. Also, he was faculty member of the Tehran University and taught religious lessons and theology. Bahonar was a reviler of the Pahlavi dynasty and had activities against Mohammad Reza Shah that led to imprisonment him in 1963, 1964, and 1975. On 1963, he was jailed for opposing the Shah's White Revolution. Also, during exile of Khomeini in Iraq and France, he continued his revolutionary activities and was an influential member among Khomeini's followers. Bahonar along with Morteza Motahari was active speaker of Hosseiniyeh Ershad, a religious lecture hall in the Tehran. Bahonar was assassinated along with Rajai and other members of Islamic Republican Party when a bomb exploded at the party's office in Tehran on 30 August 1981. In Iran, this explosion is known as the \"Hashteh-Shahrivar bombing\". The bomb was set off when one of the victims opened a briefcase. The briefcase was carried by Massoud Keshmiri, a security official at the Islamic Republican Party, to the meeting. One week later, Keshmiri was announced as responsible for planning and execution of the assassination. Keshmiri was identified as an operative of Mujahedin that was supported by Saddam Hussein. He tried to assassinate Rajai and Bahonar on 22 August when Rajai introduced his cabinet to Ruhollah Khomeini. Ahmad Khomeini explained that Keshmiri was with Rajai when they came to see Imam Khomeini. He had a suitcase but they did not allow him to bring it. He died a week before his 48th birthday. Iranian authorities announced that Massoud Keshmiri, \"a close aide to the late President Muhammad Ali Rajai and secretary of the Supreme Security Council, had been responsible.\" Keshmiri, an MEK member who was thought to have died in the explosion, \"was accorded a martyr's funeral\" and was \"buried alongside Rajai and Bahonar.\" Various MEK supporters were arrested and executed in reprisal, but Kashmiri apparently slipped through the dragnet. The reaction to both bombings was intense with many arrests and executions of MEK and other leftist groups.\n",
      "Welch was incorporated in 1893 and named after Isaiah A. Welch, a former captain in the Confederate States Army who came to the region as a surveyor, and helped establish the plan for the beginning of a new town at the confluence of Tug Fork and Elkhorn Creek. Welch was made the county seat of McDowell County in an election by county citizens in 1892 even before Welch was incorporated as a city. The previous county seat was in Perryville (now English) on present day West Virginia Route 83 along the Dry Fork. Results of the election were contested, so to avoid violence county records were secretly moved from Perryville to Welch at night in two wagons by James A. Strother and Trigg Tabor. On March 2, 1921, the Welch City Council met to discuss impeachment of then Mayor J. H. Whitt. Whitt showed up at the meeting and disrupted the proceedings. The Welch City Council then asked the McDowell Co. Sheriff's Dept. to investigate Whitt. Later that same day, Mayor Whitt shot and killed McDowell County Deputy Sheriff William Johnson Tabor who was investigating the matter. Mayor Whitt was arrested and charged with murder but won acquittal at his trial (allegedly based on perjured testimony). Whitt left the area for parts unknown on September 27, 1921. On August 1, 1921, detectives from the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency assassinated Matewan Police Chief Sid Hatfield as well as Ed Chambers at the McDowell County Courthouse located in Welch. In the first half of the 20th century during the opening of railroads and coal mines throughout the region, Welch became a prosperous city: the hub of retail business for a county approaching 100,000 in population, and the location for three hospitals. After the production boom of World War II, oil began to supplant coal in many areas of domestic fuel supply. Mechanization of coal mining reduced the number of laborers needed in coal production. McDowell County's population peaked in 1950, and began a decline over decades to follow. In 1960, however, McDowell County still ranked number one in the United States in total coal production. The City of Welch proudly proclaimed itself \"The Heart of the Nation's Coal Bin.\"\n",
      "When presidential candidate John F. Kennedy visited Welch by automobile caravan in 1960, he saw a city whose businesses were struggling due to a growing poverty rate throughout the county. What Kennedy learned here during his campaign for the 1960 West Virginia primary was believed to be the basis of the aid brought to the Appalachian region by the Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson administrations. During a speech in Canton, Ohio on September 27, 1960, he stated \"McDowell County mines more coal than it ever has in its history, probably more coal than any county in the United States and yet there are more people getting surplus food packages in McDowell County than any county in the United States. The reason is that machines are doing the jobs of men, and we have not been able to find jobs for those men.\"\n",
      "The first recipients of modern era food stamps were the Chloe and Alderson Muncy family of Paynesville, McDowell County. Their household included fifteen persons. On May 29, 1961, in the City of Welch, as a crowd of reporters witnessed the proceedings, Secretary of Agriculture Orville Freeman delivered $95 of federal food stamps to Mr. and Mrs. Muncy. This was the first issuance of federal food stamps under the Kennedy Administration, and it was the beginning of a rapidly expanding program of federal assistance that would be legislated in the \"War on Poverty.\"\n",
      "In the 1960s and 1970s, McDowell County coal continued to be a major source of fuel for the steel and electric power generation industries. As United States steel production declined, however, McDowell County suffered further losses. In 1986, the closure of the US Steel mines in nearby Gary led to an immediate loss of more than 1,200 jobs. In the following year alone, personal income in McDowell County decreased dramatically by two-thirds. Real estate values also plummeted. Miners were forced to abandon their homes in search for new beginnings in other regions of the country. In 2006, the city received national attention when it, along with Police Chief Robert K. Bowman were the defendants in a lawsuit brought by the ACLU after Bowman allegedly prevented rescuers from providing CPR to a gay man suffering cardiac arrest. After the wrongful death claim was allowed to proceed, the lawsuit was settled for an undetermined amount. In recent years, Welch has attracted the construction of new state and federal prisons which are creating some sources of economic renewal. The city has begun restoration of its historic downtown area. Welch has been the celebrated location of an annual Veterans Day Parade which over the decades has attracted a distinguished list of speakers, including Presidents Harry S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson. The McDowell County Courthouse and Welch Commercial Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The first public children's playground in West Virginia was built in Welch in 1913. It was constructed using private donations and after 1918 was maintained by the Young Women's Missionary Society of the Methodist Church. The playground sat across the street from the McDowell County Courthouse until 1930 when it became the site for the United States Post Office. Welch was the location of the first memorial building in the United States dedicated to the memory of U.S. servicemen killed in World War I, and to honor the veterans of that war. It was dedicated on May 30, 1923. The building was destroyed by fire. The historic site is now an empty lot near the county courthouse. In 1928, Welch resident Minnie Buckingham Harper became the first black woman legislator in the United States. Harper was appointed by the Governor to the West Virginia House of Delegates to fill the vacancy caused by the death of her husband. Welch also built the first municipally owned parking building in the United States, which was opened September 1, 1941. It accommodated 232 cars and showed a profit its first year in operation. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. Periodic flooding of the Elkhorn and Tug Fork rivers has plagued the future prosperity of the city. Most notably, the record flooding in 2001 and 2002 nearly destroyed Welch altogether. Flood reduction projects to prevent further destruction in the future are presently in progress. The town is a railway station on the Norfolk Southern Railway (former Norfolk and Western) network. Welch is served by \"The Welch News\", a local newspaper that currently runs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The following were born in or at some point in their lives resided in Welch:\n"

      "The Manor House is a complicated group of buildings. Its earliest part dates from the 16th century, although it is built with stone-work from two centuries earlier. No. 31 is largely 19th century, incorporating older buildings and inset with medieval elements. Sir Nikolaus Pevsner summarised that \"it is hard to discriminate between what is genuine and what is 19th century fancy\". No. 33 is mid-Georgian. No. 31 is accessed through two 18th century gate-piers adorned with pineapple finials which open onto a cobbled courtyard in front of the house. The western façade is 19th century and stone; a single-storey, it incorporates a tower, in the centre of which is a 14th-century door, beneath a small pointed window. The rear contains a blend of medieval features, including a 14th-century head of a king, set into a chimney. The north side of the courtyard contains a projected square bay dated to 1637 and incorporates an octagonal 14th century chimney piece, reckoned to have belonged to the Old Deanery in Lincoln. This joins to an 18th-century brick section, which is connected to the right with a 17th-century crow-stepped gabled stone house. A stone wall attached to that section is inset by a blocked door, the base of which forms a dog's drinking fountain. The doorway, along with some of the other imported stonework, was probably taken from the decaying Sleaford Castle, now ruined. The interior includes a room dated to the early 17th century, with panelling and Tudor Revival motifs. Rhodes House, No. 33, dates to the mid-18th century. A three-storey brick building with five bays and a classical stone door-case, with Doric columns and an entablature. To the north is a two-storey mid-19th century extension, also in brick, and an adjoining former garden wall. The rear has seven bays and two projecting wings, dating to the 18th century. Internally, one room has 17th century panelling of a Tudor design.\n",
      "The airworthiness requirements for transport category airplanes are contained in Title 14, Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 25 (commonly referred to as part 25 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR)). Manufacturers of transport category airplanes must show that each airplane they produce of a given type design complies with the relevant standards of part 25. AC 25.1309–1 describes acceptable means for showing compliance with those airworthiness requirements. It recognizes Aerospace Recommended Practices ARP4754 and ARP4761 (or their successors) as such means: AC 25.1309–1 provides background for important concepts and issues within airplane system design and analysis. Catastrophic failure condition rate\n",
      "The circular provides a rationale for the upper limit for the Average Probability per Flight Hour for Catastrophic Failure Conditions of 1 x 10−9 or \"Extremely Improbable\". Failure Conditions having more severe effects must be relatively less likely to occur; that is, an inverse relationship between severity and likelihood should be a safety objective of aviation system design. Fail-Safe Design Concept\n",
      "This AC presents the FAA \"Fail-Safe Design Concept\", which applies basic objectives pertaining to failures:\n",
      "#\"Failures of any system should be assumed for any given flight regardless of probability and such failures \"should not prevent continued safe flight and landing\" or otherwise significantly reduce safety. \"\n",
      "#\"Subsequent failure during the same flight should also be assumed.\"\n",
      "The AC lists design principles or techniques used to ensure a safe design. Usually, a combination of at least two safe design techniques are needed to provide a fail-safe design; i.e. to ensure that Major Failure Conditions are Remote, Hazardous Failure Conditions are Extremely Remote, and Catastrophic Failure Conditions are Extremely Improbable.\n",
      "Highly integrated systems\n",
      "With the emergence of \"highly integrated systems\" that perform complex and interrelated functions, particularly through the use of electronic technology and software-based techniques [e.g., Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) ], concerns arose that traditionally \"quantitative\" functional-level design and analysis techniques previously applied to simpler systems were no longer adequate. As such the AC includes expanded, methodical approaches, both qualitative and quantitative, that consider the \"integration\" of the \"whole airplane and its systems\". A main task of AC 25.1309–1 is to provide standard definitions of terms (including hazard and probability classifications) for consistent use throughout the framework set up for the accomplishment of functional airplane safety. Where regulations (FAR) and standards (ARP) may use such terms as \"failure condition\", and \"extremely improbable\", AC 25.1309–1 defines their specific meanings. In this respect, AC 25.1309–1 is comparable to ISO 26262–1 Vocabulary, at least in regard to the relative dependent standards. Key definitions include:\n",
      "\"Error\", \"Failures\", and \"Failure Conditions\"\n",
      "The re-introduction of \"Error\" to the AC recognizes the role of human error (in development, manufacture, operation, or maintenance) as a source of system failures, especially in complex and integrated avionics. The term \"Failure Conditions\" provides for a focus on the effects of a failure separate from the causes. Classification of failure conditions by severity of effect\n",
      "\"Catastrophic\", \"Hazardous\", \"Major\", \"Minor\", or \"No Safety Effect\"\n",
      "A Catastrophic Failure condition is one \"which would result in multiple fatalities, usually with the loss of the airplane. \"\n",
      "Definition of Probability Terms\n",
      "\"Extremely Improbable\", \"Extremely Remote\", \"Remote\", or \"Probable\" \n",
      "An Extremely Improbable failure condition is one so unlikely that it is not anticipated to occur during the entire operational life of all airplanes of one type. \"Quantitatively\", these probability terms are define as follows: Extremely Improbable (10−9 or less), Extremely Remote (10−7 or less), Remote (10−5 or less), Probable (more than 10−5). Classified failure conditions are assigned qualitative and quantitative safety objectives, giving guidance to development and operation. Quantitative\n",
      "The AC defines the acceptable safety level for equipment and systems as installed on the airplane and establishes an inverse relationship between Average Probability per Flight Hour and the severity of Failure Condition effects:\n",
      "#Failure Conditions with No Safety Effect have no probability requirement. #Minor Failure Conditions may be Probable. #Major Failure Conditions must be no more frequent than Remote.\n",
      "#Hazardous Failure Conditions must be no more frequent than Extremely Remote.\n",
      "#Catastrophic Failure Conditions must be Extremely Improbable. The safety objectives associated with Catastrophic Failure Conditions may be satisfied by demonstrating that:\n",
      "#No single failure will result in a Catastrophic Failure Condition; and\n",
      "#Each Catastrophic Failure Condition is extremely improbable. Qualitative\n",
      "The failure conditions \"Catastrophic\" through \"No Safety Effect\" are assigned Functional and Item Design Assurance Levels A, B, C, D, E, respectively. First released in 1982, AC 25.1309–1 has been revised to embody increasing experience in development of airplanes and to address the increasing integration and computerization of aircraft functions. AC 25.1309–1 recommended that top-down analysis should identify each system function and evaluate its criticality, i.e., either non-essential, essential, or critical. The terms Error, Failure, and Failure Condition were defined. Functions were classified Critical, Essential, and Non-Essential according to the severity of the failure conditions they could contribute to; but the conditions were not expressly classified. Failures of Critical, Essential, and Non-Essential functions were expected to be, respectively, Extremely Improbable (10–9 or less), Improbable (10–5 or less), or no worse than Probable (10–5). Previously, system safety analysis was quantitative; that is, it was dependent on evaluating the probability of system failures from physical faults of components. But with the increasing use of digital avionics (i.e., software) it was recognized that development error was a significant contributor to system failure. During system certification in the late 1970s, it became clear that the classical statistical methods of safety assessment for flight critical software based systems were not possible. Existing quantitative methods could not predict system failure rates resultant from development errors. \"Qualitative\" methods were instead recommended for reducing specification, design, and implementation errors in the development of digital avionics. The guidance of DO-178 (initial release) was recommended by AC 25.1309–1 for development of essential and critical functions implemented in software. AC 25.1309–1A introduced the FAA Fail-Safe Design Concept to this Advisory Circular. This revision also introduced recommended design principles or techniques in order to ensure a safe design. The concept of function criticality was replaced with classification of failure conditions according to severity of effects (cf., Probabilistic risk assessment). Failure conditions having Catastrophic, Major, or Minor effects were to have restricted likelihoods, respectively, of Extremely Improbable (10–9 or less), Improbable (10–5 or less), or no worse than Probable (10–5). Software was still considered to be assessed and controlled by other means; that is, by RTCA/DO-178A or later revision, via Advisory Circular AC 20-115A.\n"

      "Cooley was born in Hardin, Montana in 1911. He was one of 11 children and grew up running through the woods and playing just like a normal kid. Hunting, trapping, and fishing were big parts of his life. He loved anything to do with the outdoors. When he was just a 12-year-old boy, his father suffered a substantial financial setback. (NYTimes). He dropped out of school to help support his family. He relied on his abilities to hunt, fish, trap, and farm in order to help earn money. He went back to high school and graduated from the class of 1930. After graduation, he went on to attend and graduate from the forestry school at the University of Montana. In 1937, Cooley started his career with the Forest Service. The agency was looking for ways to improve the methods used to fight fires. Terrain in the mountains in the 1930s was almost inaccessible, and the roads almost nonexistent. (Bramwell). The challenge became focused on finding a way to get to the fire faster. The agency came up with an idea on attaching “water bombs” to a plane to drop on the fire. Although the idea was tested several times, it proved ineffective and was cancelled. (NY times) Cooley thought he could do something with the plane and brought up the idea of smokejumping – parachuting out of an airplane into a fire to get it under control. This had been tried and appeared to prove true in other countries including Russia and Germany. (Bramwell) Many American pilots were unsure about the idea of dropping firefighters into a fire from the air. There are many factors that can go wrong and they were reluctant and hesitant at the idea. Cooley and a partner by the name of Rufus Robinson began to toil with the notion. On July 12, 1940, Cooley and Robinson got their chance to test their idea. The twenty-eight-year-old who had been building roads, towers, and various other structures for the service was ready for the challenge. A forest fire had sprung up along Martin Creek in the Naz Perce National Forest. Robinson jumped first followed by Cooley. (Bushey) Their supplies were dropped on the planes’ next pass. (NY times) The next day when the four-man crew reached them, they had the fire under control. They turned around and hiked the 28 miles back to camp. (Bushey). After the service set up the smokejumpers, Cooley began training other young men on how to do exactly the same thing he did. He trained men for what the National Service called “10 o'clock men”, meaning that they could have the fire out by 10 o'clock, on the morning after they had been dispatched (Bramwell). On August 15, 1949, a fire broke out inside of a gulch in Helena National Forest in Montana. The Canyon, which had cliffs that reached 1,250 at times on both sides, made access for ground crews almost impossible. (Maclean) Cooley was not actually one of the men who jumped on this run. Instead, he was the spotter. His job was to wait for the plane to fly over the spot previously decided by the incident planning team, and give the men the signal of when to jump. He laid on the floor, next to the open door, with his foreman across from him. Cooley had to take information from the foreman, the pilot, the ground crews, and from what he could see from the air. After denying a few spots, and debating another with the foreman Wag Dodge, he finally decided on the spot he felt would be best to drop the men. (Maclean) The men lined up in groups and he gave them the signal. After four passes, all the jumpers were safely on the ground. After the jumpers landed, the plane made one more pass dumping their equipment on to the ground. They gathered it up and went to meet the ground men who were to meet them. The ground men were not where they were supposed to be. The jumpers were on their own. They continued to move on with the task at hand. As they moved along the gulch, they began to angle downward towards the fire. The fire shifted in what is known as a blow-up and turned on the men. The men panicked then tried to outrun the fire. They were quickly overtaken by the flames. There were only three survivors. (Maclean)\n",
      "This news effected Cooley harshly. He ensured that every body from his crew was recovered before he went home. Fourteen men were killed, just from his jumpers. This doesn't include all the other men who died trying to stop the fire. This is still known as the biggest smokejumper tragedy. When later inquired about the Mann Gulch fire, Cooley said “I am sure I did the right thing that day, but I still look at that map and have thought about it every day since then.” (NYTimes) After the fire, he went with local rangers to see placement of stone and concrete crosses placed on the spots at which each of the men died. It has been said that until his eighties, he would often take trips to ensure the crosses and various plaques, markers, and memorials were still standing. The majority of information on the infamous Mann Gulch fire can be found in Norman Maclean's \"Young Men and Fire\". Maclean sat down with Cooley and the survivors and wrote down the details of this event. The National Forestry service also has the incident investigation with interviews from Cooley and the three survivors within their archives.\n"

      "The use of beheading machines in Europe long predates such use during the French Revolution in 1792. An early example of the principle is found in the \"High History of the Holy Grail\", dated to about 1210. Although the device is imaginary, its function is clear. The text says:\n",
      "The Halifax Gibbet was a wooden structure consisting of two wooden uprights, capped by a horizontal beam, of a total height of . The blade was an axe head weighing 3.5 kg (7.7 lb), attached to the bottom of a massive wooden block that slid up and down in grooves in the uprights. This device was mounted on a large square platform high. It is not known when the Halifax Gibbet was first used; the first recorded execution in Halifax dates from 1280, but that execution may have been by sword, axe, or gibbet. The machine remained in use until Oliver Cromwell forbade capital punishment for petty theft. A Hans Weiditz (1495-1537) woodcut illustration from the 1532 edition of Petrarch's \"De remediis utriusque fortunae\", or \"Remedies for Both Good and Bad Fortune\" shows a device similar to the Halifax Gibbet in the background being used for an execution. Holinshed's Chronicles of 1577 included a picture of \"The execution of Murcod Ballagh near Merton in Ireland in 1307\" showing a similar execution machine, suggesting its early use in Ireland. The Maiden was constructed in 1564 for the Provost and Magistrates of Edinburgh, and was in use from April 1565 to 1710. One of those executed was James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, in 1581, and a 1644 publication began circulating the legend that Morton himself commissioned the Maiden after he had seen the Halifax Gibbet. The Maiden was readily dismantled for storage and transport, and it is now on display in the National Museum of Scotland. In Germany, the guillotine is known as the \"Fallbeil\" (\"falling hatchet\") or \"Köpfsmaschine\" (\"head [cutting] machine\") and was used in various German states from the 19th century onwards, becoming the preferred method of execution in Napoleonic times in many parts of the country. The guillotine and the firing squad were the legal methods of execution during the era of the German Empire (1871–1918) and the Weimar Republic (1919–1933). The original German guillotines resembled the French Berger 1872 model, but they eventually evolved into sturdier and more efficient machines. Built primarily of metal instead of wood, these new guillotines had heavier blades than their French predecessors and thus could use shorter uprights as well. Officials could also conduct multiple executions faster, thanks to a more efficient blade recovery system and the eventual removal of the tilting board (bascule). Those deemed likely to struggle were backed slowly into the device from behind a curtain to prevent them from seeing it prior to the execution. A metal screen covered the blade as well in order to conceal it from the sight of the condemned. Nazi Germany used the guillotine between 1933 and 1945 to execute 16,500 prisoners – 10,000 of them in 1944 and 1945 alone. One political victim the government guillotined was Sophie Scholl, who was convicted of high treason after distributing anti-Nazi pamphlets at the University of Munich with her brother Hans, and other members of the German student resistance group, the White Rose. The guillotine was last used in West Germany in 1949 in the execution of Richard Schuh and was last used in East Germany in 1966 in the execution of Horst Fischer. The Stasi used the guillotine in East Germany between 1950 and 1966 for secret executions. A number of countries, primarily in Europe, continued to employ this method of execution into the 19th and 20th centuries, but they ceased to use it before France did in 1977. In Antwerp, the last person to be beheaded was Francis Kol. Convicted of robbery and murder, he received his punishment on 8 May 1856. During the period from 19 March 1798 to 30 March 1856, there were 19 beheadings in Antwerp. In Switzerland, it was used for the last time by the canton of Obwalden in the execution of murderer Hans Vollenweider in 1940. In Greece, the guillotine (along with the firing squad) was introduced as a method of execution in 1834; it was last used in 1913. In Sweden, beheading became the mandatory method of execution in 1866. The guillotine replaced manual beheading in 1903, and it was used only once, in the execution of murderer Alfred Ander in 1910 at Långholmen Prison, Stockholm. Ander was also the last person to be executed in Sweden before capital punishment was abolished there in 1921. In South Vietnam, after the Diệm regime enacted the 10/59 Decree in 1959, mobile special military courts were dispatched to the countryside in order to intimidate the rural population; they used guillotines, which had belonged to the former French colonial power, in order to carry out death sentences on the spot. One such guillotine is still on show at the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City. In the Western Hemisphere, the guillotine saw only limited use. The only recorded guillotine execution in North America north of the Caribbean took place on the French island of St. Pierre in 1889, of Joseph Néel, with a guillotine brought in from Martinique. In the Caribbean, it was used quite rarely in Guadeloupe and Martinique, the last time in Fort-de-France in 1965. In South America, the guillotine was only used in French Guiana, where about 150 people were beheaded between 1850 and 1945: most of them were convicts exiled from France and incarcerated within the \"bagne\", or penal colonies. Within the Southern Hemisphere, it worked in New Caledonia (which had a bagne too until the end of the 19th century) and at least twice in Tahiti. In 1996 in the United States, Georgia State Representative Doug Teper unsuccessfully sponsored a bill to replace that state's electric chair with the guillotine. In recent years, a limited number of individuals have died by suicide using a guillotine which they had constructed themselves. Ever since the guillotine's first use, there has been debate as to whether or not the guillotine provided as swift and painless a death as Guillotin had hoped. With previous methods of execution that were intended to be painful, few expressed concern about the level of suffering that they inflicted. However, because the guillotine was invented specifically to be more humane, the issue of whether or not the condemned experiences pain has been thoroughly examined and has remained a controversial topic. While certain eyewitness accounts of guillotine executions suggest anecdotally that awareness may persist momentarily after decapitation, there has never been true scientific consensus on the matter. The question of consciousness or awareness following decapitation remained a topic of discussion during the guillotine's use. The following report was written by Dr. Beaurieux, who observed the head of executed prisoner Henri Languille, on 28 June 1905: During the span of its usage, the French guillotine has gone by many names, some of which include:\n"
