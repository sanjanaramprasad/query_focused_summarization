Christian Bay\\'s encyclopedia article states that civil disobedience requires \"carefully chosen and legitimate means,\" but holds that they do not have to be non-violent. It has been argued that, while both civil disobedience and civil rebellion are justified by appeal to constitutional defects, rebellion is much more destructive; therefore, the defects justifying rebellion must be much more serious than those justifying disobedience, and if one cannot justify civil rebellion, then one cannot justify a civil disobedients\\' use of force and violence and refusal to submit to arrest. Civil disobedients\\' refraining from violence is also said to help preserve society\\'s tolerance of civil disobedience.',\n",
